Q1) What is data?

    Data is information that has been translated into a form that is efficient for movement or processing. In 
    computer technology, a data type refers to an attribute of data which tells the compiler (or interpreter) 
    how the programmer intends to use the data. Data types can be of majorly three types which are:-
    1. Primitive: basic building block (boolean, integer, float, char etc.)
    2. Composite: any data type (struct, array, string etc.) composed of primitives or composite types.
    3. Abstract: data type that is defined by its behaviour (tuple, set, stack, queue, graph etc).

Q2) What is data structures?

    A data structure is a collection of data type ‘values’ which are stored and organized in such a way that it
    allows for efficient access and modification. A data structure is generally of four forms:-
    1. Linear: arrays, lists
    2. Tree: binary, heaps, space partitioning etc.
    3. Hash: distributed hash table, hash tree etc.
    4. Graphs: decision, directed, acyclic etc.
     
Q3) What is abstract data types?

    An abstract data type (ADT) is a type (or class) for objects whose behaviour is defined by a set of value 
    andva set of operations, whose concrete structure is hidden. Here, we can perform different operations. 
    But how those operations are working that is totally hidden from the user.

Q4) Need of data structures in real life?

    The root reason behind the need of data Structues is to provide a framework for organizing and storing 
    information in virtual memory forms, so that we can use it effectively and convenienty. Some of the real 
    world applications of data structures are:-
    1. Queue Data Structure while Boarding a Bus.
    2. Tree Data Structure to store the genealogy information of biological species.
    3. Graph Data Structure in Social Media and Google Map.
 
Q5) Revise the concepts of C++.
    
    Done

Q6) Explore more about Standard template library.

    STL is a set of C++ template classes to provide general-purpose classes and functions with templates that
    implement many popular and commonly used algorithms and data structures like vectors, lists, queues, and 
    stacks. Some STL containers are Set, Map, multimap, unordered_set, unordered_map, unordered_multiset, 
    unordered_multimap, stack, queue, priority_queue, vector, dequeue, list, etc.
